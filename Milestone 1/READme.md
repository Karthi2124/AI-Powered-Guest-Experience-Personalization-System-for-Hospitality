## Objective
This repository is dedicated to building a strong foundation in Python, APIs, and Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to:

- Master Python fundamentals – Covering key concepts like data structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.
- Work with APIs – Learning how to interact with RESTful and GraphQL APIs, handle authentication, and integrate external data sources.
- Explore LLMs – Understanding how large language models work, fine-tuning them, and leveraging them for real-world applications like text generation and automation.
